# Chess-Simulator

Assignment rules are as followings:

First: Your chess piece movement must follow the rules of the game.

Second: This is a one-sided board and used to illustrate how each piece moves.

Third: The program must keep track of the location of each piece. By this I mean that if a piece is moving, it must respect the position of the other pieces on the board.

Fourth: Must have some sort of graphical board.

Fifth: With each move the user should also be given the option to start a new game or end the program.
